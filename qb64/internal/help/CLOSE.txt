{{PageDescription}}
* A file MUST be closed when changing to another file mode.
* CLOSE files when they are no longer needed to save memory.
* Files cannot be opened using another number until the first one is closed.
* Use different number variables for each file when using {{KW|FREEFILE}} so that you know which one is to be closed.
* Will not return an error if a filenumber is already closed or was never opened. 
* It does not verify that a file was closed.
* {{KW|CLEAR}} will also close all open files.
* {{KW|CLOSE}} can also be used to close an open TCP/IP connection using a handle returned by the '''QB64''' {{KW|_OPENCLIENT}}, {{KW|_OPENHOST}} or {{KW|_OPENCONNECTION}} functions.
