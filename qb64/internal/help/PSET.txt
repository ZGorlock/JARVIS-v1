The '''PSET''' grahics [[SCREEN (statement)|SCREEN]] statement sets a pixel to a coordinate with a default or designated color attribute.


{{PageSyntax}}
:: PSET [STEP](''column%'', ''row%'')[, ''color_attribute'']


* Can use [[STEP]] relative graphics coordinates from a previous graphic object.
* ''Column'' and ''row'' coordinates can be offscreen.
* If the ''color attribute'' is omitted, PSET will adopt a color from a previous [[PRINT]] or graphics object's color.
* ''Color attributes'' are limited to the SCREEN mode used. Any color value other than 0 will be white in [[SCREEN (statement)|SCREEN]]s 2 or 11.
* PSET can locate other graphics objects and color [[DRAW]] statements.
* '''PSET can be used in any graphic screen mode, but cannot be used in the default screen mode 0 as it is text only!'''
