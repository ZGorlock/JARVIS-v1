The '''_MOUSEMOVEMENTX''' function returns the relative horizontal position of the mouse cursor.  



&lt;center&gt; ''Syntax:'' xposition = _MOUSEMOVEMENTX &lt;/center&gt;


* Returns the relative cursor pixel position compared to the upper left corner of the program window(0, 0).
* '''Hides the mouse cursor''' once it is inside of the program window area. This may lead to some ''&quot;confusion&quot;'' by the user! 
* Can also be used to check for any mouse movements to enable a program or close [[Screen Saver Programs]]. 


''Example:'' MOD is used to keep horizontal movement of the circle and cursor inside of the SCREEN 13 window(320).
