'''GOSUB''' sends the program to a sub program that uses a line number or label.



{{PageSyntax}}
:: GOSUB label



* Label is any [[line number]] or line label designated with a colon after it. Don't use the colon in the call.
* GOSUB procedures usually require a [[RETURN]] line at the end of the procedure.
* A procedure loop may be used to return automatically instead of using return.
* GOSUB and GOTO can be used '''within''' [[SUB]] or [[FUNCTION]] procedures, but cannot refer to a label not in the procedure itself.

* [[RESUME]] 
* [[ON TIMER (n)]]
* [[Line number]] {{text|(removal program)}}
