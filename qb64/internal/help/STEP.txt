The '''STEP''' keyword is used in [[FOR...NEXT]] loops to skip through the count or to count down instead of up. Used in graphics to designate a relative coordinate position of a graphics object function.


{{PageSyntax}}
:: FOR counter_variable = start_point TO stop_point STEP interval


* The FOR counter variable is used to designate and pass the current FOR value. 
* The STEP value can be any literal or variable numerical type.
* Start and stop point values can be any literal or variable type.
* STEP interval designates the portion to add or subtract from the FOR variable value.
* When the STEP interval is negative, then the start value should be greater than the stop value.


''Example:'' Stepping down 2 in a FOR counter loop.
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
{{Cl|FOR...NEXT}} i = 10 {{Cl|TO}} 0 {{Cl|STEP}} -2
  {{Cl|PRINT}} i;
{{Cl|NEXT}} '' ''
{{CodeEnd}}
{{OutputStart}} 
10 8 6 4 2 0 
{{OutputEnd}}
:''Note:'' The value of i = -2 after the loop is done.



::''Graphics Syntax:'' LINE STEP(column1%, row1%)-(column2%, row2%), color_attribute% 


* STEP coordinate positions are relative positive or negative pixel moves from the previous graphics object's last coordinate. After a CIRCLE statement, the relative coordinates would be from its center.
* STEP can be used before the [[LINE]], [[CIRCLE]], [[PSET]], [[PRESET]], [[PAINT]] or [[DRAW]] graphics object coordinates.



''Graphics Example:'' Using STEP coordinates to PAINT a circle's interior.
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
{{Cl|SCREEN}} 12
{{Cl|CIRCLE}} (100, 100), 50, 12
{{Cl|PAINT}} {{Cl|STEP}}(0, 0), 13, 12 '' ''
{{CodeEnd}}
:''Explanation:'' PAINT uses the CIRCLE's center coordinate position to paint the interior.
