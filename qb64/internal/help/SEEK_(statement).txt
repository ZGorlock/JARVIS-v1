The '''SEEK''' statement sets the next byte or record position of a file for a read or write.



{{PageSyntax}}
:: SEEK filenumber%, position%



* The filenumber must be a file that is [[OPEN]].
* Position is a byte in [[BINARY]] or sequencial files created in [[OUTPUT]], [[APPEND]] or [[INPUT (file mode)]]s. The first byte = 1.
* Position is the record in [[RANDOM]] files to read or write.
* Since the first file position is 1 it may require adding one to an offset value when documentation uses that position as 0.
* After a SEEK statement, the next file operation starts at that SEEK byte position.
* The SEEK statement can work with the [[SEEK]] function to move around in a file.


''Example:'' A SEEK statement using the [[SEEK]] function to move to the next random record in a file.
