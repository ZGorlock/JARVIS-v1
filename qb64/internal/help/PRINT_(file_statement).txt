The {{KW|PRINT (file statement)|PRINT #}} statement prints numeric or string expressions to a file or device.


{{PageSyntax}}
:{{KW|PRINT (file statement)|PRINT #}}{{Parameter|fileNumber%}}, [ [{{Parameter|expression}}] [{{Parameter|separator}}] ... ]


{{PageDescription}}
* {{Parameter|fileNumber%}} is the file number of a file or device opened for writing. See {{KW|OPEN}}.
* {{Parameter|expression}} is a numeric or string expression to be written.
* {{KW|SPC}}({{Parameter|n%}}) - specifies that {{Parameter|n%}} space characters will be written.
* {{KW|TAB}}({{Parameter|column%}}) - specifies that the file cursor is to move to column number {{Parameter|column%}}. If the file cursor is beyond that column, it is moved to that column on the next file row.


* {{Parameter|separator}} is used to separate multiple expressions and specifies how the file cursor is to be moved before writing the next expression. It can be one of the following:
** semi-colon (;) - specifies no change in the file cursor.
** comma (,) - specifies that the file cursor is to move to the next 14-column tab-stop. If the file cursor is at column 56 or greater, it is moved to the next file row at column 1.
* If {{Parameter|separator}} is not used at the end of the expression list, the file cursor moves to the next file row at column 1.
* PRINT # can use the '''+ concatenation''' operator or semicolons to combine strings.


* When printing numeric values, the following rules apply:
** If the value is positive, the number is prefixed with a space character, otherwise, the number is prefixed with a negative sign (-).
** If the value is an integer (whole number), no decimal point or fractional part will be written.
** If the value is not an integer (whole number) and has zero for a coefficient, no leading zero is written. For example, &lt;code&gt;-0.123&lt;/code&gt; is written as &lt;code&gt;&quot;-.123 &quot;&lt;/code&gt;
** If a numeric literal is in scientific notation, the number is also written in scientific notation. {{KW|PRINT USING (file statement)|PRINT #, USING}} can return actual numerical values in string form.
** The number is suffixed with a space character unless {{KW|STR$}}(number) is used to convert it to a string value.
* Whenever {{KW|PRINT (file statement)|PRINT #}} moves the file cursor to a new file row, a carriage return character ({{KW|CHR$|CHR$(13)}}) followed by a line feed character ({{KW|CHR$|CHR$(10)}}) is written. The combination are referred to as the &quot;CRLF&quot; character.
