The '''_MOUSEMOVE''' statement moves the mouse pointer to a new position on the screen as determined by the column and row coordinates.


{{PageSyntax}} 
:::_MOUSEMOVE column%, row%


* Maximum coordinate values are based on a program's current [[SCREEN (statement)|SCREEN]] mode resolution or the size set by [[_NEWIMAGE]].
* Can be used to position the pointer to a default dialog button or move the cursor away from a button so it is not clicked twice.
* Does NOT require [[_MOUSEINPUT]] to be used, but all moves will be remembered by it.
