The '''_DEVICE$''' function returns the [[STRING]] name and input types of the input devices on a computer.


{{PageSyntax}}
::: device$ = _DEVICE$(''device_number'')


* Returns the name of the device and input types each can use included in brackets:
:: [KEYBOARD]
:: [MOUSE]]
:: [CONTROLLER] 
* Returns the type of input after the device name as one of the following types:
:: [BUTTON] indicates there are button types of input. [[_LASTBUTTON]] can return the number of buttons available. 
:: [AXIS] indicates that there are [[SCREEN]] coordinate changing inputs that can be read.
:: [WHEEL] indicates that a scrolling input can be read. 
* '''Note: The [[_DEVICES]] function MUST be read first to get the number of devices and to enable DEVICE$ returns!'''
* '''Device numbers above the number of [[_DEVICES|devices]] found will return an OS error!'''
* Devices found include keyboard, mouse, joysticks, game pads and multiple stick game controllers.
