The '''PRESET''' graphic [[SCREEN]] statement turns a pixel at a coordinate to the background color or a designated color attribute.


{{PageSyntax}}
:: PRESET [STEP](column%, row%)[, color_attribute]


* Can use [[STEP]] relative graphics coordinates.
* Column and row coordinates can be offscreen 
* If the color attribute is omitted, a PRESET will be the background color, normally black.
* Color attributes are limited to the SCREEN mode used.
* Any color value other than 0 will be white in monochrome SCREEN modes.
* PRESET can locate other graphics objects and add color to [[DRAW]] statements.
* '''PRESET can be used in any graphic screen mode, but cannot be used in the default screen mode 0 as it is text only!'''
