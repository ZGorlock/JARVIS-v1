The {{KW|SYSTEM}} statement properly closes a Qbasic program in DOS and can avoid exiting to the QB IDE. 


{{PageSyntax}}
:{{KW|SYSTEM}} [return_code%]


{{PageDescription}}
* In '''QB64''' SYSTEM can be followed by a code that can be read in another module using the [[SHELL (function)|_SHELL]] or [[_SHELLHIDE]] function.
* This command should be used to close a program instead of using {{KW|END}} or nothing at all.
* A code can be added after the statement to send a value to the [[SHELL (function)]] or [[_SHELLHIDE]] function in another module.
* Allows BAS file modules to be run from a command line or batch file without encountering the QB IDE on exit! Very useful with Qbasic.exe to immitate a compiled program!
* If a program BAS module is run from the IDE, stopped by Ctrl-Break or an error occurs the QB program will exit to the IDE.
* In '''QB64''' it ends the program and closes the window immediately.
