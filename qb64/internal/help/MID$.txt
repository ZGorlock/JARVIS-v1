The '''MID$''' function returns a portion of a [[STRING]]'s value from any position inside a string.



{{PageSyntax}}
:: MID$(stringvalue$, startposition%[, bytes%])



* The stringvalue can be any literal or string variable having a length. See [[LEN]].
* Startposition cannot be zero(0) or an [[ERROR Codes|Illegal function call error]] will occur.
* If the start position is greater than the [[LEN|length]] of the string, nothing is returned (no error).
* Number of character bytes is optional. When not used returns the remainder of the string from the start posiition.
* Number of character bytes should be within the string's [[LEN|length]] from the start position, but will only return the string's remainder when exceeded.
* Spaces are also considered as character bytes in the string value.


''Example:'' Getting the hour and minutes from [[TIME$]]
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
 {{Cl|PRINT}} {{Cl|TIME$}}

 hour$ = {{Cl|LEFT$}}({{Cl|TIME$}}
 minutes$ = {{Cl|MID$}}({{Cl|TIME$}}, 4, 2) ' skip hours and the colon (3 characters)

 {{Cl|PRINT}} &quot;hour = &quot;; hour$; = &quot;: minutes = &quot;; minutes$
{{CodeEnd}} 

{{OutputStart}}
11:23:30
hour = 11: minutes = 23
