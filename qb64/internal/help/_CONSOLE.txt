The [[_CONSOLE]] statement can be used to turn OFF a console window or turn it on after it has been OFF.


{{PageSyntax}}
::: _CONSOLE {OFF|ON}

* _CONSOLE OFF turns the console window off once a console has been established using the [[$CONSOLE]] [[Metacommand]].
* _CONSOLE ON should only be used AFTER the console window has been turned OFF previously.
* [[_DEST]] CONSOLE can be used to send screen output to the console window using QB64 commands such as [[PRINT]].
* [[_SCREENHIDE]] or [[_SCREENSHOW]] can be used to hide or display the main program window.
* The [[$SCREENHIDE]] [[Metacommand]] can hide the main program window throughout a program when only the console is used.


''Example:'' Hiding and displaying a console window. Use [[_DELAY]] to place console in front of main program window.
