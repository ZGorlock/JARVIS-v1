An '''underscore''' can be used at the end of a line of code to continue a code line to the next line.



''Usage:'' IF x + y &gt; 500 AND x + y &lt; 600 THEN_              
:::PRINT x + y


* The underscore can be anywhere after the code on that line to continue it to the next line.
* Multiple underscores can be used for the same line of code.
* The underscore is NOT compatible with Qbasic! The Qbasic IDE will remove or hide them.
