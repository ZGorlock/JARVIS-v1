The '''_MOUSEMOVEMENTY''' function returns the relative vertical position of the mouse cursor. 


&lt;center&gt; ''Syntax:'' yposition = _MOUSEMOVEMENTY &lt;/center&gt;


* Returns relative cursor pixel position compared to the upper left corner of the program window(0, 0).
* '''Hides the mouse cursor''' once inside the program window area. This may lead to some ''&quot;confusion&quot;'' by the user!
* Can also be used to check for any mouse movements to enable a program or close [[Screen Saver Programs]].


''Example:'' MOD is used to keep vertical movement of circle and cursor inside of the SCREEN 13 window(200).
