The '''SHARED''' statement allows variables to be passed automatically to any [[SUB]] or [[FUNCTION]] procedure.



{{PageSyntax}}
:: DIM SHARED Qt AS STRING * 1


* Variables are shared with all procedures in the program module.
* When used with DIM in the main module, it eliminates the need to pass a parameter variable to a [[SUB]] or [[FUNCTION]]. 
* Does not SHARE variables with other modules. See [[COMMON SHARED]].
* Lists of variables can be made using comma separators.
* Only use SHARED ('''without DIM''') to share variables inside of [[SUB]] or [[FUNCTION]] procedures with the main module.
* '''Note: Values assigned to shared variables used as procedure call parameters will not be passed to other procedures! The shared variable value MUST be assigned INSIDE of the [[SUB]] or [[FUNCTION]] procedure to be passed!'''
