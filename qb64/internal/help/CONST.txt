The {{KW|CONST}} statement defines one or more named numeric or string values which will not change while a program is running.


{{PageSyntax}}
:{{KW|CONST}} {{Parameter|constantName}} = {{Parameter|value}}[, ...]


{{PageDescription}}
* {{Parameter|constantName}} is the constant name assigned to the constant by the programmer.
** If {{Parameter|constantName}} does not include a type suffix, the datatype is determined by {{Parameter|value}}.
* {{Parameter|value}} is the value to initialize the constant:
** If {{Parameter|constantName}} specifies a numeric type, {{Parameter|value}} must be a numeric expression containing literals and other constants.
** If {{Parameter|constantName}} specifies a string type, the {{Parameter|value}} must be a literal value.
** Constant values cannot use a variable or function return value when defined.
* Constants cannot be re-assigned values. They retain the same value throughout the program.
* Constants defined in module-level code have [[SHARED|shared]] scope, so they can be used in [[SUB]] or [[FUNCTION]] procedures.
* Constants defined in {{KW|SUB}} or {{KW|FUNCTION}} procedures are local to those procedures.
* [[CLEAR]] will not affect or change constant values.


{{PageExamples}}
: Display the circumference and area of circles:
{{CodeStart}}' Declare a numeric constant approximately equal to the ratio of a circle's
' circumference to its diameter:
{{Cl|CONST}} PI = 3.141593

' Declare some string constants:
{{Cl|CONST}} circumferenceText = &quot;The circumference of the circle is&quot;
{{Cl|CONST}} areaText = &quot;The area of the circle is&quot;

{{Cl|DO...LOOP|DO}}
    {{Cl|INPUT}} &quot;Enter the radius of a circle or zero to quit&quot;; radius
    {{Cl|IF...THEN|IF}} radius = 0 {{Cl|IF...THEN|THEN}} {{Cl|END}}
    {{Cl|PRINT}} circumferenceText; 2 * PI * radius 
    {{Cl|PRINT}} areaText; PI * radius * radius ' radius squared
    {{Cl|PRINT}}
{{Cl|DO...LOOP|LOOP}}
{{CodeEnd}}
: User-entered text is in italics:
{{OutputStart}}Enter the radius of a circle or zero to quit? ''10''
The circumference of the circle is 62.83186
The area of the circle is 314.1593

Enter the radius of a circle or zero to quit? ''123.456''
The circumference of the circle is 775.697
The area of the circle is 47882.23

Enter the radius of a circle or zero to quit? ''0''
{{OutputEnd}}
''Explanation:'' Obviously PI cannot change as it is a mathematical constant so it is very fit to define it as a constant, trying to change PI may result in an error.
