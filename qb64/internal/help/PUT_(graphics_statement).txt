The '''PUT''' graphics statement is used to place [[GET (graphics statement)|GET]] or [[BSAVE]] file images stored in the designated array.


{{PageSyntax}} 

:: PUT [{{KW|STEP}}](''column'', ''row''), Array[(''index'')][,] [{{KW|_CLIP}}]  [{PSET|PRESET|AND|OR|XOR}]][, omitcolor]


* The [[STEP]] keyword can be used to for coordinates relative to the last graphic coordinates used.
* PUT places an array image to the top left corner screen coordinate position of the box shaped image.
* '''The entire box area of the image MUST be on the screen or an &quot;Illegal function call&quot; [[ERROR Codes|error]] will occur!'''
* In '''QB64''' [[_CLIP]] can be used when part of the image may be off of the screen. This will also prevent off screen errors!
::PUT (-10, 10), mypic(0), PSET ' this causes an illegal function call without [[_CLIP]]
::PUT (-10, 10), mypic(0), _CLIP PSET ' allows a graphic to be placed partially off-screen
::PUT (-10, 10), mypic(0), _CLIP ' uses the default PUT XOR operation
::PUT (-10, 10), mypic(0), _CLIP PSET, 4 ' doesn't place the red pixels of the image
* The array must have image data at the array index given. [[GET (graphics statement)|GET]] or [[BLOAD]] should be used to place image data into the array.
* If no [[arrays|array]] index or brackets are used, the image will be assumed to be at the array start index.
* If no color action is listed after the array, the action will be assumed to be the default [[XOR]]. 
::* [[XOR]] may blend with background colors, but can be used to erase an image when placed a second time.
::* [[PSET]] completely overwrites any background with the image.
::* [[AND]] merges background colors with the black areas of the image where a white image mask is used.
::* [[OR]] blends the background and foreground colors together.
::* [[PRESET]] creates a negative of the original image completely overwriting the background.

* In '''QB64''' a color attribute can be removed from the PUT image using the ''omit color'' option instead of creating a mask.
* [[_PUTIMAGE]] is recommended over PUT as it can also do the [[GET (graphics statement)|GET]] part for you without needing an array.


''Example 1:'' How [[GET]] and PUT can be used with images loaded with [[_LOADIMAGE]]. The background color is omitted or &quot;masked&quot;.

: ''Explanation:'' '''QB64''' allows one PUT color to be &quot;masked&quot; to allow odd shaped sprite image backgrounds to be transparent.
