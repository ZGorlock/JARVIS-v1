'''$INCLUDE''' is a metacommand that is used to insert a source code file into your program which is then executed at the point of the insertion.


{{PageSyntax}}
:: {[[REM]] | [[REM|']] } $INCLUDE: 'sourcefile'


* There must always be a [[REM]] or [[REM|']] comment before the $INCLUDE metacommand.
* The source file MUST have REM or apostrophies around the name.
* The source file included can contain any BASIC statement except [[GOTO]] 
* QB 4.5 can use [[DECLARE]] SUB in BI files such as [[QB.BI]]. '''QB64''' ignores Qbasic's [[DECLARE]] statements.
* '''QB64 users can use all statements in their include files.''' The $INCLUDE of a [[SUB]] or a [[FUNCTION]] should be after ALL of your program code including SUBs and Functions! Otherwise you will get the '''QB64''' compiler error &quot;Statement cannot be placed between SUB/FUNCTIONs&quot;
* The $INCLUDE metacommand should be the only statement on a line since execution progresses ''after'' the line of the metacommand.
* $INCLUDE is often used to [[DECLARE]] functions and subs used in an external library.


&lt;center&gt;'''How to $INCLUDE a BAS or Text file with a QB64 Program'''&lt;/center&gt;

:* 1) Assemble your text code into a TEXT file and name it something with a '''.BI''' or '''.BM''' file name extension. '''NOT as .TXT!'''
:* 2) [[$INCLUDE]] any [[DEFINT]], [[DIM]], [[TYPE]], [[SHARED]] arrays or [[DATA]] at the very '''beginning''' of the main program code. 
:* 3) $INCLUDE [[SUB]]s or [[FUNCTION]]s at the very bottom of the main program code '''AFTER any SUB procedures.'''
:* 4) '''Compile''' the program with the included text files '''in the QB64 folder!''' Save the text files to use them like '''Library files'''.


''Example:'' ''' '$INCLUDE:''' '[[QB.BI]]'


''See Library Examples:'' 
* [[SelectScreen]] (member $INCLUDE demo) 
* [[FILELIST$ (function)]] (member FILE Search function)
* [[SAVEIMAGE]] (SUB program that creates bitmaps)
