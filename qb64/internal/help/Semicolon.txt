The ''semicolon'' is used in a [[PRINT]] statement to stop the cursor immediately following the printed value so that another value can be appended. 


''Usage:'' COLOR 13: PRINT &quot;Value =&quot;; value1; value2; value3

{{OutputStart}}
{{text|1234  5678  9012|magenta}}
{{OutputEnd}}


* Positive numerical values [[PRINT|printed]] will include a space before and after each value printed. 
* Use the [[WRITE]] statement to print values with only commas between the values and no spacing.
* Use a semicolon after text that will be [[PRINT|printed]] on the last two text rows of a [[SCREEN (statement)|screen mode]] to prevent screen rolling.
* [[INPUT]] statements can use the semicolon '''before''' the text to prevent screen rolling. '''INPUT ; &quot;text or question&quot;; variable'''.
* A semicolon '''after''' the text will create a question mark and space after the [[INPUT]] text question. Use a comma for statements.
* '''NOTE: Semicolons can NOT be used to combine string variables in a string variable definition!''' 
* Use the '''+''' [[concatenation]] operator to combine [[STRING|string]] variable definition values only!
