The '''_CONTROLCHR''' metacommand can be used to turn OFF control character attributes and allow them to be printed.


{{PageSyntax}}

::: _CONTROLCHR {OFF|ON}


* The [[OFF]] statement allows control characters 0 to 31 to be printed or used as normal text characters.
* The default [[ON]] statement allows control characters to be used as control commands. Some characters will not print.
* If the command is never used in a QB64 program, control characters will behave normally.
