The {{KW|TAB}} function is used in [[PRINT]] and [[LPRINT]] statements to move to a specified column position.


{{PageSyntax}}
:{{KW|TAB}}({{Parameter|column%}})


{{PageDescription}}
* Space characters are printed until the print cursor reaches the designated {{Parameter|column%}}, overwriting existing characters.
* If a subsequent TAB ''column%'' is less than a previous position, TAB moves the next print to that column on the next row.
* [[ASCII]] [[CHR$]](9) can be substituted for sequencial 9 space column moves.
* [[Comma]] PRINT spacing is up to 15 column places to a maximum column of 57.
* When printing to a file, a carriage return(CHR$(13)) and linefeed(CHR$(10)) character are output when it moves to the next row.
