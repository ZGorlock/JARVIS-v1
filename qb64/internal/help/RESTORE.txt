The '''RESTORE''' statement is used to reset the DATA pointer to the beginning of the data.


{{PageSyntax}}
:: RESTORE [datafield]


* The datafield line label or number enables a labeled data field to be [[READ]] more than once as required. 
* Datafield label names are not required when working with ONE or a progression of data fields in the main body of code.
* Label multiple data fields to restore them to use them again when necessary.
* If RESTORE is used with unlabeled data fields or no datafield is designated then the first data field is read.
* Use RESTORE to avoid an [[ERROR Codes|&quot;Out of Data&quot; error]] when reading a data field!
* See the [[DATA]] statement for [[STRING]] data value specifications.
* '''WARNING! Do not place DATA fields after [[SUB]] or [[FUNCTION]] procedures! QB64 will FAIL to compile properly!'''
: Qbasic allowed programmers to add DATA fields anywhere because the [[IDE]] separated the main code from other procedures.


''Example:'' Restoring a labeled DATA field to avoid going past the end of DATA.
