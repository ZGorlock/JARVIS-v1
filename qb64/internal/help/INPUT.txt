The '''INPUT''' statement requests a [[STRING]] or numerical keyboard entry from a program user.



{{PageSyntax}}
:: INPUT [;] [&quot;Question or statement text&quot;{,|;}] ''variable1''[, ''variable2''][, ...]



* The text MUST be a literal [[STRING|string]] created by the programmer if used. '''Use [[PRINT]] to create text using variables.'''
* INPUT is capable of returning more than one ''variable'' value. The user will have to know to separate each entry value with a comma.
* [[STRING|String]] and numerical variables can both be used in multiple entry requests. Text cannot be entered as numerical variable values!
* The user must press enter for the INPUT procedure to end. Multiple entries can be skipped.
* '''QB64''' will not return '''Redo from start errors''' as user input is limited to input within the variable type allowances.
* Use a [[semicolon]] after the INPUT keyword to prevent the screen from rolling when it is used on  the bottom 2 screen rows.
* A [[semicolon]] immediately after the text statement will display a ? mark with a space after it. A [[comma]] does not.
* For entries that may contain commas inside of the entry text value, use a [[LINE INPUT]] string entry instead.
* Will accept the [[scientific notation]] letter E or e with [[SINGLE]] variables and D or d with [[DOUBLE]] numerical values.
* Numerical entries starting with [[&amp;H]], [[&amp;O]] and [[&amp;B]] can be made also.
* INPUT removes all spaces preceeding or following a string value entry.
* The statement stops a program until enter is pressed. Not good in programs using a mouse (see [[INKEY$]]).


''Example 1:'' Using a variable in an input text message using PRINT. INPUT text cannot use variables!
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
{{Cl|INPUT}} &quot;Enter your name: &quot;, name$
{{Cl|PRINT}} name$ + &quot; please enter your age: &quot;;: {{Cl|INPUT}} &quot;&quot;, age% 'empty string with comma
{{Cl|PRINT}} name$ + &quot; how much do you weigh&quot;; : {{Cl|INPUT}} weight%   'no text adds ? '' ''
{{CodeEnd}}
:''Explanation:'' Use an empty string with a comma to eliminate the question mark that would appear without the string.


''Example 2:'' How QB64 avoids a ''Redo from start'' multiple entry error. Use commas between values!
{{CodeStart}} '' ''
{{Cl|DO}} '' ''
  {{Cl|INPUT}} &quot;What is your name, age, and sex(M/F)&quot;; name$, age%, sex$
{{Cl|LOOP}} {{Cl|UNTIL}} age%        'loop until age is not 0
{{Cl|IF}} age% &gt;= 21 {{Cl|THEN}} {{Cl|PRINT}} &quot;You can drink beer!&quot; {{Cl|ELSE}} {{Cl|PRINT}} &quot;You cannot drink beer yet!&quot;
{{Cl|END}} '' '' 
{{CodeEnd}}
{{OutputStart}}
What is your name, age, and sex(M/F)? Tom,24,M
You can drink beer!
{{OutputEnd}}
:''Explanation:'' Try to enter text for the age value and it will not work. E or D should be allowed as decimal point numerical entries.
